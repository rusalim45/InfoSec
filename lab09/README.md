## 1. What is a Package?

A **package** in Linux is a collection of files that together make up a program. 
It usually includes:
- **Executable files** (to run the program)
- **Libraries** (shared code used by other programs)
- **Configuration files** (settings)
- **Metadata** (info like version and dependencies)

## 2. Common Package Formats

 `.deb`   -  Debian / Ubuntu ( For Debian-based systems )
 `.rpm`   - Fedora / Red Hat ( For Red Hat-based systems )
 `.tar.gz`- All Linux systems ( Source code packages )

## 3. What is a Package Manager?

It automatically handles dependencies and updates.

The main tool for Ubuntu and Debian systems is **`apt`** (Advanced Package Tool).
